1)Give a Static IP address for eth0. 
2)say for example 172.168.10.0.
3)It can be given by ifconfig eth0 172.168.10.0,Test it by giving ifconfig command.
4)In Linux x86 System if you enter ifconfig you could be able to see enp0s25, that is the interface for ethernet
5)The same step 3 need to follow in Linux x86 system, by giving ifcnofig enp0s25 172.168.10.5
6)after giving this command ensure it by running ifconfig ccomand and you can see the address as mentioned in the above step.
7)Connect the BBB to x86 Linux System using a Ethernet RJ45 Cable.
8)Ensure the connnectivity between the Two devices using ping commmand, ping 172.168.10.0 from Linux system and vice-versa.
9)If ping is successfull, proceed to further steps else repeat the same steps from above 1-8.
10)Enter SCP file_to_copy remote@172.168.10.0:/destination folder(Ex tmp)
11)Follow this Link for SCP https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-scp-command-to-securely-transfer-files/
